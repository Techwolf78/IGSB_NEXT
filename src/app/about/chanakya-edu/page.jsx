              The Shree Chanakya Education Society (SCES) was established in
              February 1994, under the visionary leadership of Dr. Tarita
              Shankar, with the aim of providing top quality post-graduate
              education in the ﬁelds of Business Management, International
              Business and Information Technology. By consistently providing
              quality education over the past few decades, institutes at Indira
              Group is now considered as one of the best institutes in Pune. At
              a time when India was struggling to put its economy back on its
              feet, after the nation having pawned the “family jewels” just to
              keep aﬂoat, Dr. Tarita Shankar sensed that education too would
              have to become more broad based and more vocational in nature if
              India was to stand up to the world competition in quality and
              price for its products, The then Finance Minister had prescribed
              for the economy and so, in 1994, began a saga of growth and
              quality in education; a story that is just reaching its zenith
              with 14 full ﬂedged Institutes registering a strong presence on
              Pune’s educational horizon. Since inception, the Institutes
              managed by SCES, have maintained high academic standards and have
              successfully provided trained manpower to the industrial and
              services sector of the country. These institutes are now listed
              amongst the top colleges not just in Pune, but also in Maharashtra
              and India. With a modest strength of 60 students pursuing a single
              course, SCES has grown steadily and today boasts of 14 Institutes,
              having more than 8000 students from all over India pursuing
              multi-disciplinary, graduate & post-graduate programs. The
              objective of the institute is providing ‘Management education in a
              corporate environment’, has been possible due to the sincere and
              dedicated efforts of the members of SCES, who have invaluable
              experience in varied areas like academics, industry, service and
              social-world.

            </h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-lg">
              About Indira Global School of Business (IGSB) has been established
              with the explicit vision to train managers with a global
              perspective who can provide sustainable impetus to growing
              international business. IGSB has established its presence in Pune
              as a premier B- School offering MBA (MBA and MBA - Services
              Management) affiliated to Savitribai Phule Pune University and
              approved by AICTE, New Delhi. As a driving philosophy, the belief
              is that the emerging global environment has created a scenario
              where managers have to face greater situational challenges,
              predict and handle the vagaries of the market and provide
              sustainable strategic solutions to corporate issues. The current
              global economy has created an environment where managers have to
              face greater situational challenges; predict and handle the
              impulses of the market and provide quality service management.
              Such an environment requires professional graduates not only armed
              with the necessary knowledge but also the confidence of facing
              extreme competition with greater articulation. The IGSB campus is
              located imposingly adjoining the Mumbai-Pune Expressway, on a
              beautiful site amidst open fields and clusters of large trees in a
              beautiful, green valley which gives a sense of endless space to
              the quest of mind and soul. The infrastructure is dynamic in
              nature because of our constant attempt to maintain pace with the
              development opportunities available to us. Our infrastructure acts
              as a facilitator for the effective delivery of our curriculum and
              nurtures the quest for knowledge. The MBA programs (MBA and MBA -
              Services Management) at IGSB equip students with fresh insights
              and alternative ways of thinking, helping them to succeed in
              highly unpredictable and non-linear conditions, making global
              leaders out of them.
